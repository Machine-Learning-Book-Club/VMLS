    "- Vector Entry Labels\n",
    "    - It's common to keep a separate list of labels or tags that explain or annotate the meaning of vector entires.\n",
    "    - For example, we may take the portfolio vector (100, 20, 300) with the ticker symbols (AAPL, INTC, AMZN) so we know that assets 1, 2, and 3, are Apple, Intel, and Amazon"
